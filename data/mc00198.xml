            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Henry Leveke Kamphoefner, the son of a Methodist preacher, was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1907. He attended 
                <corpname>Morningside College</corpname> in 
                <geogname>Sioux City, Iowa</geogname> from 1924 to 1926 and graduated in 1930 from the 
                <corpname>University of Illinois</corpname> with a Bachelor of Science degree in architecture. In 1931, he received a Master of Science degree in architecture from Columbia University, and in 1932, he received a Certificate in Architecture from the Beaux Arts Institute of Design in New York.</p>
            <p>Kamphoefner returned to Sioux City in 1932 and privately practiced architecture there through 1936. From 1936 through 1937, he worked as an associate architect for the Rural Resettlement Administration in Washington, D.C. Kamphoefner then took a position as professor of architecture at the 
                <corpname>University of Oklahoma</corpname>, where he remained through 1948. During his tenure there, he also worked as an architect for the United States Navy during the summers of 1938, 1939, and 1941. Kamphoefner was also a visiting professor at the University of Michigan during the summer of 1947. In 1948, Kamphoefner became the first dean of the North Carolina State College (later North Carolina State University) School of Design. He remained as dean until 1973, when he retired and was named dean emeritus. He continued teaching until 1979, when the mandatory retirement age of 72 was invoked by the university and Kamphoefner was required to leave. Following his retirement from North Carolina State, Kamphoefner became Distinguished Visiting Professor at 
                <corpname>Meredith College</corpname> in Raleigh, where he remained from 1979-1981.</p>
            <p>Kamphoefner's professional activities included acting as president of the Raleigh Council of Architects (1955-1956); as a member of the Board of Directors (1965), treasurer (1959-1963), director (1959-1967), and president (1963-1965) of the 
                <corpname>Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture</corpname> (ACSA); as a member of the Design Panel of Architects to the United States Navy (1964); and as National Endowment for the Humanities Humanist in Residence in Fayetteville, North Carolina (Fall 1977). Kamphoefner received several awards and honors for his professional work, including an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Morningside College (1967); an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Ball State University (1972); an award in Joint Achievement for Lasting Achievement in Architectural Education (1977); and a North Carolina Award for Achievement in the Fine Arts (1978). His 1934 building, the 
                <corpname>Grandview Music Pavilion</corpname> in Sioux City, Iowa, was selected by the Royal Institute of British Architects as one of "America's Outstanding Buildings of the Post-War Period."</p>
            <p>Kamphoefner married 
                <persname>Mabel C. Franchere</persname> on January 5, 1937. He died in Raleigh on February 14, 1990.</p>

                    <p>This series reflects Kamphoefner's devotion to modern design. Many of his speeches and lectures are controversial in their criticism of traditional architecture and responses to these statements and opinions are well-documented in the 
                        <ref ns2:show="embed" ns2:href="" target="ref15">Professional Correspondence</ref> series. Lectures also include research and preparation for his classes. Publications contain information relating to his writing and his architectural projects, especially his residences in Norman, Oklahoma and Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>

                    <p>This series contains several thousand photographs of Kamphoefner's projects, friends, associates, and family, along with some photographs of buildings designed by other architects. All of Kamphoefner's built projects are represented, with the exception of the McEvare Residence in Southern Pines, North Carolina. The postcard collection contains images of chiefly European buildings, possibly collected during Kamphoefner's trip to Europe in 1930. Photographs are arranged first by size, then by subject. 
                        <emph render="doublequote">Note: This arrangement causes several subjects to be spread among separate containers.</emph></p>

                    <p>This series chiefly includes architectural drawings done by Kamphoefner throughout his career. It also includes several study drawings done by Kamphoefner as a student between 1927 and 1932. All of Kamphoefner's built projects are represented as well as several competition entries and proposed projects. There are several oversized photographs as well. There is also one folder of diplomas, awards, and certificates earned by Kamphoefner. A series of scrapbooks that were kept by Mabel Kamphoefner is found at the end of the series. The scrapbooks document Henry Kamphoefner's achievements throughout his career with special emphasis on the success of the School of Design at North Carolina State University. The series is arranged first by general size of the material, then by subject. Accordingly, several subjects are spread among folders.</p>

                    <p>This series comprises some late accessions to the collection. These materials have been arranged in three subseries: Photographs, Artifacts and Memorabilia, and Publications. Travel snapshots of landscapes and buildings from the American West and several national parks make up the bulk of the photographs subseries. The artifacts and memorabilia subseries includes personal effects belonging to Henry L. Kamphoefner and his wife, Mabel C. Kamphoefner. The publications subseries contains only one item: a copy of the book "Your Solar House" (1947), to which Henry L. Kamphoefner contributed.</p>
